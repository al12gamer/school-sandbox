# School Sandbox
Sandbox WIP so high schools can teach their kids IT

### Installation
Documentation regarding using our easy GUI to spin up the sandbox and access the web GUI after getting an API key for your class. Once you run the Python installer, it will call Packet to spin up a vps for you. Refer to [here](https://www.packet.com/developers/api/) for getting your own Packet API or [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-setup-api-key-with-console.html) for AWS access. This is a capstone project proof-of-concept so it may be rough around the edges.

### Running
